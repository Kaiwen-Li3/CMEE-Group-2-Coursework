# Oak Species Filtering Script

This script reads a CSV file containing tree species data, identifies species from the **Quercus** genus (oak trees), and writes the filtered results to a separate CSV file. The input file is located in the `../data` directory, and the output will be saved in the `../results` directory. The script is designed to prevent duplicate oak species from appearing in the output.

## Running the Script

**Important:** This script uses relative paths for both input and output files. To ensure the script runs correctly, you **must execute the script from within the `code` folder**. This is necessary because the input data file (`TestOaksData.csv`) is located in the `../data` folder relative to the code, and the results will be saved in the `../results` folder.
